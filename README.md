What Is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic programming is a computer programming technique where an algorithmic problem is first broken down into sub-problems, the results are saved, and then the sub-problems are optimized to find the overall solution â€” which usually has to do with finding the maximum and minimum range of the algorithmic query. 

Some of the problem I have solved are:
Climbing stairs problem :
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
